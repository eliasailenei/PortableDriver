ONLY ASUS, VMWARE AND QEMU WORKS NOW HOTFIX AND MORE VENDORS ARE ON THE WAY!

New feature:
- You now get the latest version of FireFox everytime you run the program. This should fix the problems where the vendors detect the crawler.

Lenovo, Dell and HP are in the works right now.

Silent install and setup customisation (e.g. where to store the drivers and to install quietly) will be added later as its not a priority rn and it works just fine without it.
